These courses are largely adapted from [Google's technical writing courses][homepage]. This page has details specific to
RoboJackets spring training.

[Kristaps Berzinch][email] will be facilitating these courses for Spring 2021. If you have any questions, please post in
[#technical-writing](slack://channel?team=T033JPZLT&id=C01R3118C2C).

As the in-class sessions are primarily an exercise and discussion forum, and Google has restricted access to the slides
to facilitators, neither the slides nor recordings of the in-class sessions will be published.

## Technical Writing One

This course focuses on the critical basics of technical writing. It consists of 2 hours of pre-class material and a
2-hour in-class session.

From the [course overview][overview]:

>The pre-class components introduce topics; the in-class components help students integrate and practice those topics.
>That said, the pre-class work, by itself, provides significant educational value.

### Before the class

Complete the following tasks before the in-class portion of the course.

- **Join the [#technical-writing](slack://channel?team=T033JPZLT&id=C01R3118C2C) channel** in our Slack workspace. This
  is where I will post announcements regarding the course.
- **Review [the pre-class material][preclass] (2 hours),** ideally including the optional sections and exercises.
- **Complete [this WhenIsGood][whenisgood]** so I can determine the best time for the in-class session. I will try to
  fit everyone in the same session to keep it more interesting.
- **RSVP to the session once a time is confirmed.** The link to do so will be posted here later; keep an eye on
  [#technical-writing](slack://channel?team=T033JPZLT&id=C01R3118C2C) for updates. Participants will work in pairs for a
  significant portion of the session, so please RSVP if you are planning to attend so that I can make useful
  assignments.

### During the class

You will be working with another participant on a variety of writing exercises. Please RSVP above so I can pair you up!

### After the class

I will post a short survey to gather feedback on the session.

## Technical Writing Two

Stay tuned.
