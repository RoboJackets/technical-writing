These courses are largely adapted from [Google's technical writing courses][homepage]. This page has details specific to
RoboJackets spring training.

[Kristaps Berzinch][email] will facilitate these courses for Spring 2021. If you have any questions, please post in
[#technical-writing](slack://channel?team=T033JPZLT&id=C01R3118C2C).

As the in-class sessions are primarily an exercise and discussion forum, and Google has restricted access to the slides
to facilitators, neither the slides nor recordings of the in-class sessions will be published.

## Technical Writing One

This course focuses on the critical basics of technical writing, including guidelines for clearer writing, sentence
structure, and paragraph structure. It consists of 2 hours of pre-class material and a 2-hour in-class session.

### Before the class

Complete the following tasks before the in-class portion of the course.

- **Join the [#technical-writing](slack://channel?team=T033JPZLT&id=C01R3118C2C) channel** in our Slack workspace. This
  is where I will post announcements regarding the course.
- **Review [the pre-class material][one-preclass] (2 hours),** ideally including the optional sections and exercises.
- **Complete [this WhenIsGood][one-whenisgood]** so I can determine the best time for the in-class session. I will try to
  fit everyone in the same session to keep it more interesting.
- **RSVP to the session once a time is confirmed.** The link to do so will be posted here later; keep an eye on
  [#technical-writing](slack://channel?team=T033JPZLT&id=C01R3118C2C) for updates. Participants will work in pairs for a
  significant portion of the session, so please RSVP if you are planning to attend. If the scheduled time does not work
  for you, consider attending one of [the sessions hosted by Google][google-hosted].

### During the class

You will be working with another participant on a variety of writing exercises. Please RSVP above so I can pair you up!

Each pair will need one copy of [this Google Doc][one-inclass] and a Google Meet link or other voice channel. Pairs
will be announced during the session.

### After the class

Please submit [this short survey][one-survey] with feedback regarding the course, and consider signing up for Technical
Writing Two!
